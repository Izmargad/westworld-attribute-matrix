Westworld Attribute Matrix
====

Interactive radar chart based on the host attribute matrix from Westworld Season 1 Episode 6 “The Adversary.”

![Demo](README/demo.gif)

A series of archived configurations tells Maeve’s story over the course of the season, while sliders show what it might feel like to configure host attributes directly through the radar chart.
